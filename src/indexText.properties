welcome_page.p.firstParagraph = Our team plans to develop a restaurant review site with a binary system of "Would you recommend this place: Yes or No?" instead of the standard type of star review. The idea comes from seeing the removal of stars from multiple different types of sites with review aspects like YouTube, RottenTomatoes, and even Facebook with their Likes button. The main features included are: user accounts(using secure encryption for personal information and private data such as a password), restaurant name catalogue with a rating based on how many people like it in the form of a percentage and optional reviews left by users, and a "Places I'Äôve visited/wishlistÄù" of restaurants the users have added.
welcome_page.p.secondParagraph = Users will connect to the site's home page through whichever client they choose that supports webpages. From the home page, users will be able to search for a specific restaurant and if found, will be directed to that restaurant's page. On every restaurant's page, guest users will be able to see that restaurants score and reviews posted for it, but not be able to vote on the restaurants. If the users have created an account and signed in, they will then be able to vote on the restaurant and leave a review if they want to.
welcome_page.p.thirdParagraph = Application will also be bilingual (English and French). All clients will interact strictly through the Apache Tomcat server, and every request that requires access to the database will be done so through the web server, which in turn will perform pre-defined queries to the MySQL database. In a final, real world environment, this database will be scaled to multiple geographic locations, providing data to nearby web servers in the region.
